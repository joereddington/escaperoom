# Synopsis


This is a demonstration of a simple template to be used in a 'escape game' research project. 

Each page using this template will ask the user a question. If they get the right answer they will be taken to a success page. If they get it wrong - NO penalty, but if the timer runs out, they go to a fail page. 


## Webapp 
There is an ugly web version to play with the tags and concept at the github pages site [here](https://joereddington.github.io/escaperoom/). It needs to be made pretty with some css, this is to demonstration the functionality.
